# esphome Driver for the SiC45X
WIP - this project is work in progress.

This project aims to implement a wrapper (with some specific calibration functions for leds) between esphome and a modified version of https://github.com/scheffield/sic45x-driver to drive leds.

An example configuration can be found in example.yaml
